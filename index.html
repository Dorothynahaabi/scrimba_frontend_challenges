       <p><b>The cats of America are under siege!</b></p>

       <p>Long gone are the good old days when a cat's biggest worries were mean <br> dogs or a bath. Modern cats must
        confront satanists, online predators, the <br> possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland
       and <br> countless other threats to their nine lives.</p>
       <p>For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at <br> the vanguard of our country's 
       defense by helping to prepare our nation's cat <br> owners for the difficult conversations they dread having with
       their pets. </p>
       <p>Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety <br> answers crucial questions such as,
       "What is the right age to talk to my cat <br> about the proper use of firearms?" and "What are the benefits of my cat
       <br> living a lifestyle of abstinence?" and especially "Why does my cat need to <br> use the internet? Can't he just
        play with yarn like cats used to do?"</p>
